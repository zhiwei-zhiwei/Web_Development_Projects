10 points

**DUE: Friday, March 31 by 5:30pm**

For easiest viewing of these instructions, view online on Github.com or use a Markdown previewer.

### Instructions

This assignment will help you get practice with HTML and
some CSS as well.  Some HTML/CSS research might be required.

Update your `myname.html` document on uchicagowebdev.com to include:
- Your name in the title bar
- an ordered list of your favorite foods
- an unordered list of your favorite movies or TV shows
- an 8x8 table of multiplication facts 1-8
- a link to a wikipedia article about a cute animal

Then, modify `resume.html` so that it looks like [resume-target.png](resume-target.png).

Refer to [resume-specifications.png](resume-specifications.png) for exact requirements.  Note 
that the entire content of the page should be a width of 960px, and that the page should be 
centered on your screen.

HINT: You will need to research how to specify fonts in CSS, as well as how the `margin`
property can be used to center an element on the screen.

ANOTHER HINT: You only need to add CSS code inside the `<style>...</style>` element.  No other HTML
changes should be necessary.

`yourname.html`
- Title
